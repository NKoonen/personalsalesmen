# Personal Salesmen
This module lets you assign a customer or customer group to an employee. The employee will only see his/her assigned customers, and no other customers. So if you have customers that often return to your shop, but should only be managed by one of your employee's and it's private, this is your module!
If you are logged in as the SuperAdmin you can see all the customers and employee's.

# Features:

- Easily manage customer orders
- Less hectic order overview for your employee's
- Private sales restricted for employees
- Less work for SuperAdmin to assign chores
- Linked employee receives email upon new order
- Link employees to customer groups
- Fully functional for Multistores

# Installation:

After the installation and enabling the module, any employee that is not a Superadmin will only see his/her assigned customers and orders. If you don't make any links, the other employees wont be able to see any customers or orders. So if you have not configured the module any other employees will not see anything at al!

We recommend making a special employee profile for your Personal Salesmen (Advanced parameters > Team > Profiles). In order to have the module work, every employee should have the permission: View & Configure to the Personal Salesmen module.

If the permission is not set the profile of your employees the filters wonâ€™t work.

If you are using the Prestashop Multistore function, please make sure upon installing the module that you have all the stores selected. (in de right upper corner) If you have not, the module will not function properly.

# How to use:

As show in the image below, you can add and remove links. Once you have created a link this employee will be able to everything to the selected customer as set in the employee profile permissions.

By clicking on the red trashcan you can delete a link between any employee and his/her group or customer. (Before PS 1.7.7 you can only delete all the links of employees)

You can also link employees to a customer group. This makes it really easy to assign employees to multiple users at once.

  As shown in the image below you can link the employee to a customer group. This means in the future if you set a customer to a group, this will automatically be visible to the linked employee. This is a really great function for B2B to, for company's that have a responsible employee per department.

# Other languages:

If you are not using English as main language for your shop, you should manually copy the folder mails/en and replace the en for the language you are using in the backoffice. For example there is a folder mails/nl for the nl language.
